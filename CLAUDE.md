# Claude Behaviours

- Please read `README.md` first before any planning or action (ensure it is in your context)
- ALWAYS prioritize clean simple code that's robust and has packages with good community support
- Due to simplicity, prefer Python/Typescript + Railway
- We'll be using Telegram bots
- NEVER have any emojis (but allow the fundamental diamond heart clubs spades for UI)
- Max 20 users concurrently to narrow project scope
